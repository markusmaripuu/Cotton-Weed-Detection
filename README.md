## Project Motivation  
This project is part of the Kaggle competition "3LC Cotton Weed Detection Challenge", which focuses on detecting weeds in cotton fields. Our motivation for this competition is now only getting a good grade in Introduction to Data Science course, but also our intrest and goal to get better and better mAP@50 score in the Kaggle competition. Ultimately, our goal is not only to build a working YOLO-based weed detection model, but also to deepen our understanding of the full data science workflow and strengthen our skills as future practitioners.

## Project Goal  
The goal of this project is to develop an effective object detection model capable of identifying weeds in cotton field images.  
More specifically, our objectives are to:

- Train a YOLOv8-based model to detect weeds with high accuracy  
- Improve mAP@50 performance through experimentation, hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation and label fixing.
- Produce valid submission files for the Kaggle competition
- Finish in 50% of the public leaderboard of the competition
