## Overview

The goal of the competition is to build a model that can **detect and classify cotton weeds** from field imagery. The task combines object detection, classification, and dealing with highly variable vegetation backgrounds. All the participants are provided with training dataset (542 training images) and validation dataset (133 validation images). These pictures contain various plants some of which are these 3 cotton weeds that the model has to detect: 
1. Carpet Weed (class 0)
2. Morning glory (class 1)
3. Palmer Amaranth (class 2)

The given pictures are labeled and the annotations are given by agricultural specialists and trained field workers.
